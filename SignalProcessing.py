        AWGN channel
        Add AWGN noise to input signal. The function adds AWGN noise vector to signal 's' to generate a resulting signal vector 'r' of specified SNR in dB. It also
        returns the noise vector 'n' that is added to the signal 's' and the power spectral density N0 of noise added
        Parameters:
            s : input/transmitted signal vector
            SNRdB : desired signal to noise ratio (expressed in dB) for the received signal
            L : oversampling factor (applicable for waveform simulation) default L = 1.
        Returns:
            r : received signal vector (r=s+n)
